partial_sort(num.begin(),num.begin()+k,num.end(),greater<int>());

this function is use for sort the array by a certain index "K" 
so it is save the time 

partial_sort() is O(N*log K) where N is the number of elements in array
and K is the number of elements between middle and start.
The partial_sort() is faster than sort() if K is significantly smaller
than N as partial_sort() will sort first K elements whereas sort() will sort all the N elements.

// nth_element()
nth_element(): The nth_element() is an STL algorithm 
which rearranges the list in such a way such that 
the element at the nth position is the one which should be at that position 
if we sort the list. It does not sort the list, just that all the elements, 
which precede the nth element are not greater than it, and all the elements which succeed it are not less than it.
